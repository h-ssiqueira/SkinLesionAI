# Templates Overview

Each of notebooks have the objective of train and save a model based on the [HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000). There are slighty differences noted below:

* [templateDownload](templateDownload.ipynb) - Download the dataset using a kaggle.json authentication file.
* [templateDrive](templateDrive.ipynb) - When the dataset is saved on Google Drive, it could delay to load all the images into the runtime memory.
* [templateFormDownload](templateFormDownload.ipynb) - Download the dataset using a kaggle.json authentication file and also the configuration block in form format.
